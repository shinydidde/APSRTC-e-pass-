                  <li>
                    It is being used fraudulently, or

				<img src="buses/1.gif">
                <p>
                  You can travel free of charge on almost all local bus services throughout Wales.&nbsp; In addition you can travel to and from towns just over the border in England, providing there is no change of bus involved.
                </p>
                <p>
                  You can also travel free of charge on certain journeys provided by local Community Transport Operators in the Rhondda Cynon Taf area.
                </p>
                <p>
                  However, you cannot travel free on certain types of services, for example:
                </p>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    Rail Link bus services, which connect with trains and charge rail based fares.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    National Express / Long distance coach services.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Buses operating tourist services.

                <h2>
                  How do I use my bus pass?
                </h2>
                <p>
                  Your bus pass contains a small electronic chip (often referred to as a Smartcard) which is used to check your concessionary entitlement and ensure that the bus operator is paid for your travel.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <strong>Please ensure that you keep your pass in a safe place where it cannot be bent, twisted, or damaged and in a separate compartment from other bank cards etc.</strong>&nbsp; If you keep your pass in a wallet or purse, you must allow the driver to see your photograph.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Local service buses are fitted with a new style ticket machine, next to the entrance, called a “Reader”.&nbsp; When you board, please hold your concessionary bus pass in close proximity to the “Reader”, with your photograph face up.&nbsp; This will electronically register the pass and confirm it is valid and acknowledge that the pass has been read.&nbsp; It will then respond with a bleep, a green light and you maybe issued with a ticket before you take your seat.
                </p>
                <p>
                  In the event of this not happening it may be the case that your bus pass has a fault.&nbsp; The driver will ask to see your bus pass before you will be allowed free travel.&nbsp; Please see <a href="http://www.rctcbc.gov.uk/en/transportstreets/publictransport/buspass-generalinformation/buspass-generalinformation.aspx#Faulty">What if my pass becomes faulty?</a><span style="display:none">|</span> for further information.

                  This notice tells you about how your personal information is used and made available to the Welsh&nbsp; Government, Regional Transport Consortia, Local Authorities, and bus operators, for the purposes of administering and participating in the all Wales concessionary fare scheme.

                <p>
                  Information about you will be obtained in two ways.&nbsp; Initially, when you apply for a concessionary bus pass the Local Authority will process your application and hold your information in a database.&nbsp; This will be added to by the Local Authority when it receives information about you from the bus operator who will record details of your bus journeys.&nbsp;

                  The sort of personal information held includes:-
                </p>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    Personal details such as name, address, date of birth, National Insurance Number and nature of disability (if applicable)

                <h3>
                  The use made of this personal information
                </h3>
                <p>
                  Information is used by the Welsh Government to reimburse bus operators for the numbers of concessionary journeys made by pass holders.&nbsp; The Welsh Government also uses information for research purposes, such as the numbers of journeys made over a daily, weekly and monthly basis, the most popular and least popular times, and geographic area for journeys etc.&nbsp; This information will inform transport policy changes and funding in the future.&nbsp; However, the information processed for research purposes is done in a way that ensures individual pass holders cannot be indentified.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The Regional Transport Consortia also use the personal information collected to do similar research to that undertaken by the Welsh Government and to calculate the amount to be paid to bus operators within its own region.&nbsp; However, the information it has access to and makes use of is limited to the pass holders who live and who travel on the local transport within its own region.&nbsp; This research is also done in a way that ensures individual pass holders cannot be identified.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The Local Authority uses the information it collects to administer local transport that it supports within its own area.&nbsp; For example:
                </p>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    For planning, and development of transport policy
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    The provision and management of the transport services to local communities
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Monitoring and reporting on transport services
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    The giving of support and guidance to local communities and transport operators
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    The organisation of transport events
                  </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                  Information is also used by Local Authorities to reimburse bus operators for concessionary journeys made by pass holders.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Administration and payment calculations are done in a way that ensures individual pass holders cannot be identified.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The bus operator will provide journey details to the Welsh&nbsp;Government, Regional Transport Consortia and Local Authorities to enable their payment to be calculated.&nbsp; They will not have access to the personal information of pass holders.&nbsp; Although the journey details they record will include a unique pass holder number, the bus operators will not be able to use this information to identify individual pass holders.
                </p>
                <h3>
                  Organisations who may share personal information

                <p>
                  Information held by the bus operators, Local Authorities, Regional Transport Consortia and the Welsh&nbsp; government on pass holders may be shared with other organisations where the law allows, for example with:

                  Traveline Cymru provides times and route information about all bus, coach, rail, ferry and air services in Wales.&nbsp; Calls can be made in English or Welsh to 0871 200 22 33 between 7am and 10pm every day*.&nbsp; Friendly experienced staff can pinpoint any location and bus stop in Wales and provide information about public transport journeys and connections.&nbsp;<br>
                  <br>
                  An internet based enquiry service is also available by clicking on the Traveline Cymru link.&nbsp; You can also receive bus times from <a href="http://www.travelinecymru.info/">Traveline Cymru</a><span style="display:none">|</span> on mobile phones via text messaging (SMS).&nbsp; You will need to enter the unique 7 letter bus stop code (which can be found at the bus stop or on the Traveline Cymru website) to 84268.&nbsp; You will then receive a reply via text showing the times, the service number and destination of up to the next four buses due at that particular stop.<br>
                  <br>

                  Is my bus pass valid on coaches or trains?
                </h2>
                <p>
                  No.&nbsp; Passes are valid for free travel on local bus services throughout Wales.&nbsp; These include some limited stop bus services but not coach services e.g. National Express or the rail-link services which connect with trains.&nbsp; However, you will find that the railway operators and many coach companies offer discounted fare schemes to concessionary passholders.

                  If it is confirmed that your pass is no longer working then a replacement pass will be requested for you.&nbsp; If you have visited in person at either the Aberdare or Pontypridd One4All Centres, staff will be able to issue you with a replacement bus pass during your visit (this is subject to the equipment being in working order at the time of your visit).&nbsp;<br>

                <p>
                  Please remember that you are the only person allowed to use your bus pass.&nbsp; Where a companion pass has been issued, the companion will be permitted to travel at the same time and on the same journey as the passholder.&nbsp; If you allow someone else to use it, your pass could be cancelled and/or its renewal refused and it may also lead to legal action.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Travel using a bus pass is subject to the normal regulations and conditions of the bus operator(s).&nbsp; Your pass must be shown whenever requested by a driver or inspector.&nbsp; Your pass does not give you any rights other than those enjoyed by any fare paying passenger, nor does it entitle you to be carried in preference to other passengers.

                <p>
